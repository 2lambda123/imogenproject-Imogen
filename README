The Imogen Magnetohydrodynamics Code is an advanced astrophysical simulation tool. It solves the
equations of compressible ideal MHD using a TVD method that is second order in space and time.

Simulations are started from the run/ directory, normally in the form
  ./imogen runfile_Name.m number &
where 'number' causes output to be directed to ~/Results/logfile_number.out and the & detaches the
simulation from the console. Output will be stored in ~/Results/MONTH_YY in a simulation-dependent
directory.

=== GPU support

This version of Imogen runs the fluid entirely the CPU (except for solving the self gravity
equation). gpuImogen runs the fluid on the GPU and is available at
https://github.com/imogenproject/gpuImogen
